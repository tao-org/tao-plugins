    "description": "MODIS Thermal Anomalies/Fire products are primarily derived from MODIS 4- and 11-micrometer radiances. The fire detection strategy is based on absolute detection of a fire (when the fire strength is sufficient to detect), and on detection relative to its background (to account for variability of the surface temperature and reflection by sunlight). Numerous tests are employed to reject typical false alarm sources like sun glint or an unmasked coastline. Information on individual MODIS Thermal Anomalies and Fire Products along with improvements/changes for Version 6 are available at: https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/dataset_discovery/?f[0]=im_field_dataset_version%3A32&f[1]=im_field_product%3A12.",
