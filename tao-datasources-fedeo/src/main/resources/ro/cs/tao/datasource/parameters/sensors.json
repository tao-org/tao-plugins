The data from different sensors and the resulting synergistic data products require a high level of accuracy that can only be obtained through continuous traceable calibration and validation activities.Requirement:Initiate an activity to document a reference methodology to predict Top of Atmosphere (TOA) radiance for which currently flying and planned wide swath sensors can be intercompared, i.e. define a standard for traceability. Also create and maintain a fully accessible web page containing, on an instrument basis, links to all instrument characteristics needed for intercomparisons as specified above, ideally in a common format. In addition, create and maintain a database (e.g. SADE) of instrument data for specific vicarious calibration sites, including site characteristics, in a common format. Each agency is responsible for providing data for their instruments in this common format. Recommendation : The required activities described above should be supported for an implementation period of two years and a maintenance period over two subsequent years. The CEOS should encourage a member agency to accept the lead role in supporting this activity. CEOS should request all member agencies to support this activity by providing appropriate information and data in a timely manner.Pseudo-Invariant Calibration Sites (PICS):Algeria 3 is one of six CEOS reference Pseudo-Invariant Calibration Sites (PICS) that are CEOS Reference Test Sites. Besides the nominally good site characteristics (temporal stability, uniformity, homogeneity, etc.), these six PICS were selected by also taking into account their heritage and the large number of datasets from multiple instruments that already existed in the EO archives and the long history of characterization performed over these sites. The PICS have high reflectance and are usually made up of sand dunes with climatologically low aerosol loading and practically no vegetation. Consequently, these PICS can be used to evaluate the long-term stability of instrument and facilitate inter-comparison of multiple instruments.",

The CCMP datasets combine cross-calibrated satellite winds obtained from Remote Sensing Systems (REMSS) using a Variational Analysis Method (VAM) to produce a high-resolution (0.25 degree) gridded analysis. The CCMP data set includes cross-calibrated satellite winds derived from SSM/I, SSMIS, AMSR-E, TRMM TMI, QuikSCAT, SeaWinds, WindSat and other satellite instruments as they become available from REMSS. REMSS uses a cross-calibrated sea-surface emissivity model function which improves the consistency between wind speed retrievals from microwave radiometers (i.e., SSM/I, SSMIS, AMSR, TMI, WindSat) and those from scatterometers (i.e., QuikSCAT and SeaWinds). The VAM combines these data with in situ measurements and a starting estimate (first guess) of the wind field. The European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) ERA-40 Reanalysis is used as the first-guess from 1987 to 1998. The ECMWF Operational analysis is used from January 1999 onward. All wind observations and analysis fields are referenced to a height of 10 meters. The ERA-40 can be obtained from the Computation and Information Systems Laboratory (CISL) at the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR): http://rda.ucar.edu/datasets/ds117.0/. The ECMWF Operational analysis can also be obtained from CISL at NCAR: http://rda.ucar.edu/datasets/ds111.1/. Three products are distributed to complete the CCMP dataset series.

Directions from the L3.0 product are then assigned to the time and location of the passive microwave satellite wind speed observations to derive the L2.5 product.  All datasets are distributed on a 0.25 degree cylindrical coordinate grid. This dataset is one in a series of First-Look (FLK) CCMP datasets and is a continuation and expansion of the SSM/I surface wind velocity project that began under the NASA Pathfinder Program. Refinements and upgrades to the FLK version will be incorporated under a new release (date to be determined) known as Late-look (LLK) and may include additional satellite datasets. All satellite surface wind data are obtained from REMSS under the DISCOVER project: Distributed Information Services: Climate/Ocean Products and Visualizations for Earth Research (http://www.discover-earth.org/index.html). The CCMP project is the result of an investigation funded by the NASA Making Earth Science data records for Use in Research Environments (MEaSUREs) program (http://community.eosdis.nasa.gov/measures/). In accordance with the MEaSUREs program, the CCMP datasets are also known as Earth System Data Records (ESDRs). In collaboration with private and government institutions, a team led by Dr. Robert Atlas (PI; proposal originally solicited by REASoN, and currently funded by MEaSURES) has created the CCMP project to provide multi-instrument ocean surface wind velocity ESDRs, with wide ranging research applications in meteorology and oceanography.",

Processing Levels: - Level 1A - Single-look Complex Slant (SCSB and SCSU) : RAW data focused in slant range-azimuth projection, that is the sensor natural acquisition projection; product contains In-Phase and Quadrature of the focused data, weighted and radiometrically equalised. The processing of the 1A_SCSU product differs from that of the 1A_SCSB product for the following features: a non-weighted processing is performed, which means that windowing isn't applied on the processed bandwidth; radiometric equalisation (in terms of compensation of the range antenna pattern and incidence angle) is not performed; hence only compensation of the antenna transmitter gain and receiver attenuation and range spreading loss is applied.• Level 1B - Detected Ground Multi-look (DGM): product obtained detecting, multi-looking and projecting the Single-look Complex Slant data onto a grid regular in ground. Spotlight Mode products are not multi-looked - Level 1C - Geocoded Ellipsoid Corrected (GEC) and Level 1D - Geocoded Terrain Corrected (GTC): Obtained projecting the Level 1A product onto a regular grid in a chosen cartographic reference system. In case of Lev 1C the surface is the earth ellipsoid while for the Lev 1D a DEM (Digital Elevation Model) is used to approximate the real earth surface.",

    "description": "'Short description:' Altimeter satellite gridded Sea Level Anomalies (SLA) computed with respect to a twenty-year [1993, 2012] mean. The SLA is estimated by Optimal Interpolation, merging the measurement from the different altimeter missions available (see QUID document or http://duacs.cls.fr [http://duacs.cls.fr] pages for processing details). The product gives additional variables (i.e. Absolute Dynamic Topography and geostrophic currents (absolute and anomalies)).This product is processed by the DUACS multimission altimeter data processing system. It serves in near-real time the main operational oceanography and climate forecasting centers in Europe and worldwide. It processes data from all altimeter missions: Jason-3, Sentinel-3A, HY-2A, Saral/AltiKa, Cryosat-2, Jason-2, Jason-1, T/P, ENVISAT, GFO, ERS1/2. It provides a consistent and homogeneous catalogue of products for varied applications, both for near real time applications and offline studies. To produce maps of Sea Level Anomalies (SLA) and Absolute Dynamic Topography (ADT) in delayed-time (REPROCESSED), the system uses the along-track altimeter missions from products called SEALEVEL*_PHY_L3_REP_OBSERVATIONS_008_*. Finally an Optimal Interpolation is made merging all the flying satellites in order to compute gridded SLA and ADT. The geostrophic currents are derived from sla (geostrophic velocities anomalies, ugosa and vgosa variables) and from adt (absolute geostrophic velicities, ugos and vgos variables). Note that the gridded products can be visualized on the LAS (Live Access Data) Aviso+ web page (http://www.aviso.altimetry.fr/en/data/data-access/las-live-access-server.html [http://www.aviso.altimetry.fr/en/data/data-access/las-live-access-server.html])",

The system was developed to provide precise orbit determination and high accuracy location of ground beacons for point positioning. DORIS is a dual-frequency Doppler system that has been included as an experiment on various space missions such as TOPEX/Poseidon, SPOT-2, -3, -4, and -5, Envisat, and Jason satellites. Unlike many other navigation systems, DORIS is based on an uplink device. The receivers are on board the satellite with the transmitters are on the ground. This creates a centralized system in which the complete set of observations is downloaded by the satellite to the ground center, from where they are distributed after editing and processing. An accurate measurment is made of the Doppler shift on radiofrequency signals emitted by the ground beacons and received on the spacecraft.",

CryoSat also carries three star trackers for measuring the orientation of the baseline. In addition, a radio receiver called Doppler Orbit and Radio Positioning Integration by Satellite (DORIS) and a small laser retroreflector ensures that CryoSat's position will be accurately tracked. More detailed information on CryoSat instruments is available on the CryoSat mission page. The following CryoSat datasets are available and distributed to registered users: Level 1B and L2 Ice products: FDM, LRM, SAR and SARIn Consolidated Level 2 (GDR): (LRM+SAR+SARIN) consolidated ice products over an orbit Intermediate Level 2 Ice products: LRM, SAR and SARIn L1b and L2 Ocean Products: GOP and IOP CryoTEMPO EOLIS Point Products CryoTEMPO EOLIS Gridded Products Detailed information concerning each of the above datasets is available in the CryoSat Products Overview (https://earth.esa.int/eogateway/missions/cryosat/products) and in the news item: CryoSat Ocean Products now open to scientific community (https://earth.esa.int/web/guest/missions/esa-operational-eo-missions/cryosat/news/-/asset_publisher/47bD/content/cryosat-ocean-products-now-open-to-scientific-community). CryoSat Level 1B altimetric products contain time and geo-location information as well as SIRAL measurements in engineering units. Calibration corrections are included and have been applied to the window delay computations. In Offline products, geophysical corrections are computed from Analysis Auxiliary Data Files (ADFs), whereas in FDM products corrections are computed for Forecast ADFs. All corrections are included in the data products and therefore the range can be calculated by taking into account the surface type. The Offline Level 2 LRM, SAR and SARIn ice altimetric products are generated 30 days after data acquisition and are principally dedicated to glaciologists working on sea-ice and land-ice areas. The Level 2 FDM products are near-real time ocean products, generated 2-3 hours after data acquisition, and fulfill the needs of some ocean operational services. Level 2 products contain the time of measurement, the geo-location and the height of the surface. IOP and GOP are outputs of the CryoSat Ocean Processor. These products are dedicated to the study of ocean surfaces, and provided specifically for the needs of the oceanographic community. IOP are generated 2-3 days after data sensing acquisition and use the DORIS Preliminary Orbit. GOP are typically generated 30 days after data sensing acquisition and use the DORIS Precise Orbit. Geophysical corrections are computed from the Analysis ADFs, however following the oceanographic convention the corrections are available but not directly applied to the range (as for FDM). The ESA CryoSat ThEMatic PrOducts - SWATH Cryo-TEMPO products (CryoTEMPO-EOLIS) exploit CryoSat's SARIn mode and the novel Swath processing technique to deliver increased spatial and temporal coverage of time-dependent elevation over land ice, a critical metric for tracking ice mass trends in support to a wide variety of end-users working in the areas of sea ice, polar oceans, land ice, coastal areas and hydrology. The dataset consists of systematic reprocessing of the entire CryoSat archive to generate new L2-Swath products, increasing data sampling by 1 to 2 orders of magnitude compared with the operational L2 ESA product. In addition, the EOLIS dataset is joined with the ESA L2 Point-Of-Closest-Approach to generate monthly DEM (Digital Elevation Model) products. This dataset will further the ability of the community to analyse and understand trends across the Greenland Ice Sheet margin.",

The CCMP data set includes cross-calibrated satellite winds derived from SSM/I, SSMIS, AMSR-E, TRMM TMI, QuikSCAT, SeaWinds, WindSat and other satellite instruments as they become available from REMSS. REMSS uses a cross-calibrated sea-surface emissivity model function which improves the consistency between wind speed retrievals from microwave radiometers (i.e., SSM/I, SSMIS, AMSR, TMI, WindSat) and those from scatterometers (i.e., QuikSCAT and SeaWinds). The VAM combines these data with in situ measurements and a starting estimate (first guess) of the wind field. The European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) ERA-40 Reanalysis is used as the first-guess from 1987 to 1998. The ECMWF Operational analysis is used from January 1999 onward. All wind observations and analysis fields are referenced to a height of 10 meters. The ERA-40 can be obtained from the Computation and Information Systems Laboratory (CISL) at the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR): http://rda.ucar.edu/datasets/ds117.0/. The ECMWF Operational analysis can also be obtained from CISL at NCAR: http://rda.ucar.edu/datasets/ds111.1/. Three products are distributed to complete the CCMP dataset series. L3.0 product contains high-resolution analyses every 6-hours. These data are then time averaged over monthly and 5-day periods to derive the L3.5 product. Directions from the L3.0 product are then assigned to the time and location of the passive microwave satellite wind speed observations to derive the L2.5 product.  All datasets are distributed on a 0.25 degree cylindrical coordinate grid. This dataset is one in a series of First-Look (FLK) CCMP datasets and is a continuation and expansion of the SSM/I surface wind velocity project that began under the NASA Pathfinder Program. Refinements and upgrades to the FLK version will be incorporated under a new release (date to be determined) known as Late-look (LLK) and may include additional satellite datasets. All satellite surface wind data are obtained from REMSS under the DISCOVER project: Distributed Information Services: Climate/Ocean Products and Visualizations for Earth Research (http://www.discover-earth.org/index.html). The CCMP project is the result of an investigation funded by the NASA Making Earth Science data records for Use in Research Environments (MEaSUREs) program (http://community.eosdis.nasa.gov/measures/). In accordance with the MEaSUREs program, the CCMP datasets are also known as Earth System Data Records (ESDRs). In collaboration with private and government institutions, a team led by Dr. Robert Atlas (PI; proposal originally solicited by REASoN, and currently funded by MEaSURES) has created the CCMP project to provide multi-instrument ocean surface wind velocity ESDRs, with wide ranging research applications in meteorology and oceanography.",

    "description": "On the background of these requirements for sensor calibration, intercalibration and product validation, the subgroup on Calibration and Validation of the Committee on Earth Observing System (CEOS) formulated the following recommendation during the plenary session held in China at the end of 2004, with the goal of setting-up and operating an internet based system to provide sensor data, protocols and guidelines for these purposes:Background:Reference Datasets are required to support the understanding of climate change and quality assure operational services by Earth Observing satellites. The data from different sensors and the resulting synergistic data products require a high level of accuracy that can only be obtained through continuous traceable calibration and validation activities.Requirement:Initiate an activity to document a reference methodology to predict Top of Atmosphere (TOA) radiance for which currently flying and planned wide swath sensors can be intercompared, i.e. define a standard for traceability. Also create and maintain a fully accessible web page containing, on an instrument basis, links to all instrument characteristics needed for intercomparisons as specified above, ideally in a common format. In addition, create and maintain a database (e.g. SADE) of instrument data for specific vicarious calibration sites, including site characteristics, in a common format. Each agency is responsible for providing data for their instruments in this common format. Recommendation : The required activities described above should be supported for an implementation period of two years and a maintenance period over two subsequent years. The CEOS should encourage a member agency to accept the lead role in supporting this activity. CEOS should request all member agencies to support this activity by providing appropriate information and data in a timely manner.Pseudo-Invariant Calibration Sites (PICS):Algeria 3 is one of six CEOS reference Pseudo-Invariant Calibration Sites (PICS) that are CEOS Reference Test Sites. Besides the nominally good site characteristics (temporal stability, uniformity, homogeneity, etc.), these six PICS were selected by also taking into account their heritage and the large number of datasets from multiple instruments that already existed in the EO archives and the long history of characterization performed over these sites. The PICS have high reflectance and are usually made up of sand dunes with climatologically low aerosol loading and practically no vegetation. Consequently, these PICS can be used to evaluate the long-term stability of instrument and facilitate inter-comparison of multiple instruments.",

The product gives additional variables (i.e. Absolute Dynamic Topography and geostrophic currents (absolute and anomalies)).This product is processed by the DUACS multimission altimeter data processing system. It serves in near-real time the main operational oceanography and climate forecasting centers in Europe and worldwide. It processes data from all altimeter missions: Jason-3, Sentinel-3A, HY-2A, Saral/AltiKa, Cryosat-2, Jason-2, Jason-1, T/P, ENVISAT, GFO, ERS1/2. It provides a consistent and homogeneous catalogue of products for varied applications, both for near real time applications and offline studies. To produce maps of Sea Level Anomalies (SLA) and Absolute Dynamic Topography (ADT) in delayed-time (REPROCESSED), the system uses the along-track altimeter missions from products called SEALEVEL*_PHY_L3_REP_OBSERVATIONS_008_*. Finally an Optimal Interpolation is made merging all the flying satellites in order to compute gridded SLA and ADT. The geostrophic currents are derived from sla (geostrophic velocities anomalies, ugosa and vgosa variables) and from adt (absolute geostrophic velicities, ugos and vgos variables).

The MERIS FR Level 1 product has Sentinel 3-like format starting from the 4th reprocessing data released to users in July 2020. Each measurement and annotation data file is in NetCDF 4. The Level 1 product is composed of 22 data files: 15 files containing radiances at each band (one band per file), accompanied by the associated error estimates, and 7 annotation data files. The 15 sun spectral flux values provided in the instrument data file of the Level 1 products are the in-band reference irradiances adjusted for the Earth-sun distance at the time of measurement. The band-pass of each pixel is derived from on-ground and in-flight characterisation via an instrument model. The values 'Band wavelength' and 'Bandwidth' provided in the Manifest file of the Level 1b products are the averaged band-pass of each pixel over the instrument field of view. Auxiliary data are also listed in the Manifest file associated to each product. The Level 1 FR product covers the complete instrument swath. The product duration is not fixed and it can span up to the time interval of the input Level 0 (for a maximum of 20 minutes).

The pixel size of approximately 18 x 24.2 metres for raw data is newly dimensioned to 18 x 18 metres for System Corrected data using a cubic convolution algorithm. Disclaimer: Cloud coverage for JERS OPS products has not been computed using an algorithm. The cloud cover assignment was performed manually by operators at the acquisition stations. Due to missing attitude information, the Nadir looking band (band 3) and the corresponding forward looking band (band 4) are not well coregistered, resulting in some accuracy limitations. The quality control was not performed systematically for each frame. A subset of the entire JERS Optical dataset was selected and manually checked.

The return signal, typically a few photons, is collected by a telescope and the time-of-flight is measured. Using information about the satellite's orbit, the time-of-flight, and the speed of light, the location of the ranging station can be determined. Similar data acquired by another station, many kilometers distant from the first, or on a different continent, can be used to determine the distance between stations to precisions of centimeters or better. Repetitive measurements over months and years yield the change in distance, or the motion of the Earth's crust.",

This is the original radiance data, sampled to 30 Km and 3-hour spacing. Data collection for this product is complete and was collected using several instruments on multiple platforms, please see the instrument and platform list of this record for a comprehensive list. The normalization of all radiances to a standard calibration made these data a globally uniform set of measurements that can be used for detailed cloud process studies.ISCCP was the first project of the World Climate Research Program (WCRP) and was established in 1982 (WMO-35 1982, Schiffer and Rossow 1983) to: produce a global, reduced resolution, calibrated and normalized radiance data set containing basic information on the properties of the atmosphere from which cloud parameters can be derived; stimulate and coordinate basic research on techniques for inferring the physical properties of clouds from the condensed radiance data set and to apply the resulting algorithms to derive and validate a global cloud climatology for improving the parameterization of clouds in climate models; and promote research using ISCCP data that contributes to improved understanding of the Earth's radiation budget and hydrological cycle. Since 1983 an international group of institutions has collected and analyzed satellite radiance measurements from up to five geostationary and two polar orbiting satellites to infer the global distribution of cloud properties and their diurnal, seasonal and inter-annual variations. The primary focus of the first phase of the project (1983-1995) was the elucidation of the role of clouds in the radiation budget (top of the atmosphere and surface). In the second phase of the project (1995 onwards) the analysis also concerns improving understanding of clouds in the global hydrological cycle. ISCCP analysis combined satellite-measured radiances (Stage B3 data, Schiffer and Rossow 1985), Rossow et al. 1987) with the TOVS atmospheric temperature-humidity and ice/snow correlative data sets to obtain information about clouds and the surface. The analysis method first determined the presence of absence of clouds in each individual image pixel and retrieves the radiometric properties of the cloud for each cloudy pixel and of the surface for each clear pixel. The pixel analysis is performed separately for each satellite radiance data set and the results reported in the Stage DX data product, which has a nominal resolution of 30 km and 3 hours. The Stage D1 product is produced by summarizing the pixel-level results every 3 hours on an equal-area map with 280 km resolution and merging the results from separate satellites with the atmospheric and ice/snow data sets to produce global coverage at each time. The Stage D2 data product is produced by averaging the Stage D1 data over each month, first at each of the eight three hour time intervals and then over all time intervals.",

The GPM mission is a joint effort between NASA, the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) and other international partners. In march 2005, NASA has chosen the Ball Aerospace and Technologies Corp., Boulder, Colorado to build the GMI instrument on the continued success of the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) satellite by expanding current coverage of precipitation from the tropics to the entire world. GMI is a dual-polarization, multi-channel, conical-scanning, passive microwave radiometer with frequent revisit times. One of the primary differences between GPM and other satellites with microwave radiometers is the orbit, which is inclined 65 degrees, allowing a full sampling of all local Earth times repeated approximately every 2 weeks. The GPM platform undergoes yaw maneuvers approximately every 40 days to compensate for the sun's changing position and prevent the side of the spacecraft facing the sun from overheating. Today, the GMI instrument plays an essential role in the worldwide measurement of precipitation and environmental forecasting. Sea Surface Temperature (SST) is one of its major products. The GMI data from the Remote Sensing System (REMSS) have been produced using an updated RTM, Version-8. The V8 brightness temperatures from GMI are slightly different from the V7 brightness temperatures; The SST datasets are available in near-real time (NRT) as they arrive, with a delay of about 3 to 6 hours, including the Daily, 3-Day, Weekly, and Monthly time series products.",

This results in a long image strip parallel to the flight direction: the transmitted pulse bandwidth is adjusted to always achieve a ground range resolution of 3 m. - Spot instrument mode: the radar beam is steered to illuminate a fixed point to increase the illumination time, resulting in an extended Synthetic aperture length, which improves the azimuth resolution. Spot mode uses a 300 MHz pulse bandwidth and provides a slant plane image with a resolution of 0.5 m (range) by 0.25 m (azimuth); when translated into the ground, the products has 1 m resolution covering an area of 5 km x 5 km. Due to multi-looking, speckle noise is significantly reduced - Scan Instrument mode: the phased array antenna is used to create multiple beams in the elevation direction which allows to acquire a large area (100km x 100km) with resolution better than 15m. To achieve the finest image quality of its Scan image, ICEYE employs a TOPSAR technique, which brings major benefits over the quality of the images obtained with conventional SCANSAR imaging. With the 2-dimensional electronic beam steering, TOPSAR ensures the maximum radar power distribution in the scene, providing uniform image quality. Two different processing levels can be requested: - Single Look Complex (SLC): Single Look Complex (SLC) Level 1a products consist of focused SAR data geo-referenced using orbit and attitude data from the satellite and the scenes are stored in the satellite's native image acquisition geometry which is the slant-range-by-azimuth imaging plane and with zero-Doppler SAR coordinates. The pixels are spaced equidistant in azimuth and in slant range. The products include a single look in each dimension using the full transmit signal bandwidth and consist of complex magnitude value samples preserving both amplitude and phase information. No radiometric artefacts induced by spatial resampling or geocoding. The product is provided in Hierarchical Data Format (HDF5) plus a xml file with selected metadata. - Ground Range Detected (GRD): Ground Range Detected (GRD) Level 1b products consist of focused SAR data that has been detected, multi-looked and projected to ground range using an Earth ellipsoid model. The image coordinates are oriented along the flight direction and along the ground range. Pixel values represent detected magnitude, the phase information is lost. The resulting product has approximately square spatial resolution pixels and square pixel spacing with reduced speckle due to the multi-look processing at the cost of worse spatial resolution. No image rotation to a map coordinate system has been performed and interpolation artefacts are thus avoided. The product is provided in GeoTiff plus a xml file with selected metadata. / Strip / Spot / Scan // Ground range resolution (GRD) / 3 m / 1 m / &lt;15m // Ground azimuth resolution (GRD) / 3 m / 1 m / &lt;15 m // Slant range resolution (SLC) / 0.5 - 2.5 m / 0.5 m / // Slant azimuth resolution (SLC) / 3.0 m / 0.25 m / // Scene size (W x L) / 30 x 50 km2 / 5 x 5 km2 / 100 x 100 km2 // Incident angle / 15 - 30° / 20 - 35° / 21-29° // Polarisation / VV / VV / VV // All details about the data provision, data access conditions and quota assignment procedure are described in the ICEYE _$$Terms of Applicability$$ https://earth.esa.int/pi/esa?id=5800&amp;sideExpandedNavigationBoxId=Aos&amp;cmd=image&amp;topSelectedNavigationNodeId=AOS&amp;targetIFramePage=/web/guest/pi-community/apply-for-data/ao-s&amp;ts=1600785820771&amp;type=file&amp;colorTheme=03&amp;sideNavigationType=AO&amp;table=aotarget .

Using information about the satellite's orbit, the time-of-flight, and the speed of light, the location of the ranging station can be determined. Similar data acquired by another station, many kilometers distant from the first, or on a different continent, can be used to determine the distance between stations to precisions of centimeters or better.

The data from different sensors and the resulting synergistic data products require a high level of accuracy that can only be obtained through continuous traceable calibration and validation activities.Requirement:Initiate an activity to document a reference methodology to predict Top of Atmosphere (TOA) radiance for which currently flying and planned wide swath sensors can be intercompared, i.e. define a standard for traceability. Also create and maintain a fully accessible web page containing, on an instrument basis, links to all instrument characteristics needed for intercomparisons as specified above, ideally in a common format. In addition, create and maintain a database (e.g. SADE) of instrument data for specific vicarious calibration sites, including site characteristics, in a common format. Each agency is responsible for providing data for their instruments in this common format. Recommendation : The required activities described above should be supported for an implementation period of two years and a maintenance period over two subsequent years. The CEOS should encourage a member agency to accept the lead role in supporting this activity. CEOS should request all member agencies to support this activity by providing appropriate information and data in a timely manner.Pseudo-Invariant Calibration Sites (PICS):Algeria 3 is one of six CEOS reference Pseudo-Invariant Calibration Sites (PICS) that are CEOS Reference Test Sites. Besides the nominally good site characteristics (temporal stability, uniformity, homogeneity, etc.), these six PICS were selected by also taking into account their heritage and the large number of datasets from multiple instruments that already existed in the EO archives and the long history of characterization performed over these sites. The PICS have high reflectance and are usually made up of sand dunes with climatologically low aerosol loading and practically no vegetation. Consequently, these PICS can be used to evaluate the long-term stability of instrument and facilitate inter-comparison of multiple instruments.",

A limited amount of images have been acquired through January 2013. Landsat MSS image data consist of four spectral bands (band designations), although the specific band designations changed between Landsats 1-3 and Landsats 4-5. The resolution for all bands of 79 m, and approximate scene size is 170 km north-south by 185 km east-west (106 mi by 115 miles). Landsat Collection 1 provides a quality-controlled selection of radiometrically calibrated and consistently geolocated data; particular geodetic accuracy and error tolerances are specified to align pixels for time series analysis through the full Landsat record.

This is the original radiance data, sampled to 30 Km and 3-hour spacing. Data collection for this product is complete and was collected using several instruments on multiple platforms, please see the instrument and platform list of this record for a comprehensive list. The normalization of all radiances to a standard calibration made these data a globally uniform set of measurements that can be used for detailed cloud process studies.ISCCP was the first project of the World Climate Research Program (WCRP) and was established in 1982 (WMO-35 1982, Schiffer and Rossow 1983) to: produce a global, reduced resolution, calibrated and normalized radiance data set containing basic information on the properties of the atmosphere from which cloud parameters can be derived; stimulate and coordinate basic research on techniques for inferring the physical properties of clouds from the condensed radiance data set and to apply the resulting algorithms to derive and validate a global cloud climatology for improving the parameterization of clouds in climate models; and promote research using ISCCP data that contributes to improved understanding of the Earth's radiation budget and hydrological cycle. Since 1983 an international group of institutions has collected and analyzed satellite radiance measurements from up to five geostationary and two polar orbiting satellites to infer the global distribution of cloud properties and their diurnal, seasonal and inter-annual variations. The primary focus of the first phase of the project (1983-1995) was the elucidation of the role of clouds in the radiation budget (top of the atmosphere and surface). In the second phase of the project (1995 onwards) the analysis also concerns improving understanding of clouds in the global hydrological cycle. ISCCP analysis combined satellite-measured radiances (Stage B3 data, Schiffer and Rossow 1985), Rossow et al. 1987) with the TOVS atmospheric temperature-humidity and ice/snow correlative data sets to obtain information about clouds and the surface. The analysis method first determined the presence of absence of clouds in each individual image pixel and retrieves the radiometric properties of the cloud for each cloudy pixel and of the surface for each clear pixel. The pixel analysis is performed separately for each satellite radiance data set and the results reported in the Stage DX data product, which has a nominal resolution of 30 km and 3 hours. The Stage D1 product is produced by summarizing the pixel-level results every 3 hours on an equal-area map with 280 km resolution and merging the results from separate satellites with the atmospheric and ice/snow data sets to produce global coverage at each time. The Stage D2 data product is produced by averaging the Stage D1 data over each month, first at each of the eight three hour time intervals and then over all time intervals.",

    "description": "On the background of these requirements for sensor calibration, intercalibration and product validation, the subgroup on Calibration and Validation of the Committee on Earth Observing System (CEOS) formulated the following recommendation during the plenary session held in China at the end of 2004, with the goal of setting-up and operating an internet based system to provide sensor data, protocols and guidelines for these purposes:Background:Reference Datasets are required to support the understanding of climate change and quality assure operational services by Earth Observing satellites. The data from different sensors and the resulting synergistic data products require a high level of accuracy that can only be obtained through continuous traceable calibration and validation activities.Requirement:Initiate an activity to document a reference methodology to predict Top of Atmosphere (TOA) radiance for which currently flying and planned wide swath sensors can be intercompared, i.e. define a standard for traceability. Also create and maintain a fully accessible web page containing, on an instrument basis, links to all instrument characteristics needed for intercomparisons as specified above, ideally in a common format. In addition, create and maintain a database (e.g. SADE) of instrument data for specific vicarious calibration sites, including site characteristics, in a common format. Each agency is responsible for providing data for their instruments in this common format. Recommendation : The required activities described above should be supported for an implementation period of two years and a maintenance period over two subsequent years. The CEOS should encourage a member agency to accept the lead role in supporting this activity. CEOS should request all member agencies to support this activity by providing appropriate information and data in a timely manner.Pseudo-Invariant Calibration Sites (PICS):Algeria 3 is one of six CEOS reference Pseudo-Invariant Calibration Sites (PICS) that are CEOS Reference Test Sites. Besides the nominally good site characteristics (temporal stability, uniformity, homogeneity, etc.), these six PICS were selected by also taking into account their heritage and the large number of datasets from multiple instruments that already existed in the EO archives and the long history of characterization performed over these sites. The PICS have high reflectance and are usually made up of sand dunes with climatologically low aerosol loading and practically no vegetation. Consequently, these PICS can be used to evaluate the long-term stability of instrument and facilitate inter-comparison of multiple instruments.",

The SST data in this data set are used operationally in oceanographic analyses and forecasts by the US Naval Oceanographic Office (NAVO). The MetOp satellite program is a European multi-satellite program to provide weather data services for monitoring climate and improving weather forecasts. MetOp-A, MetOp-B and Metop-C were respectively launched on 19 Oct 2006, 17 September 2012 and 7 November 2018. The program was jointly established by the European Space Agency (ESA) and the European Organization for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT) with the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) contributing the AVHRR sensor. AVHRR instruments measure the radiance of the Earth in 5 (or 6) relatively wide spectral bands. The first two are centered around the red (0.6 micron) and near-infrared (0.9 micron) regions, the third one is located around 4 (3.6) micron, and the last two sample the emitted thermal radiation, around 11 and 12 micron, respectively. The legacy 5 band instrument is known as AVHRR\/2 while the more recent version, the AVHRR\/3 (first carried on the NOAA-15 platform), acquires data in a 6th channel located at 1.6 micron. Typically, the 11 and 12 micron channels are used to derive SST sometimes in combination with the 3.5 micron channel. The swath of the AVHRR sensor is a relatively large 2400 km. All MetOp platforms are sun synchronous and generally view the same earth location twice a day (latitude dependent). The ground native resolution of the AVHRR instruments is approximately 1.1 km at nadir and degrades off nadir. This particular data set is produced from legacy Global Area Coverage (GAC) data that are derived from a sample averaging of the full resolution global AVHRR data. Four out of every five samples along the scan line are used to compute on average value and the data from only every third scan line are processed, yielding an effective 4 km spatial resolution at nadir. The v2.0 is the updated version from current v1.0 with extensive algorithm improvements and upgrades. The major improvements include: 1) Significant changes in contaminant\/cloud detection; 2) Increased the spatial resolution from 9 km to 4 km; 3) Updated compliance with GDS2, ACDD 1.3, and CF 1.6; and 4) Removed the dependency on the High-resolution Infrared Radiation Sounder (HIRS) sensor (only available to MetOp-A\/B), thus allowing for the consistent inter-calibration and the processing of MetOp-A\/B\/C data",

The data from different sensors and the resulting synergistic data products require a high level of accuracy that can only be obtained through continuous traceable calibration and validation activities.Requirement:Initiate an activity to document a reference methodology to predict Top of Atmosphere (TOA) radiance for which currently flying and planned wide swath sensors can be intercompared, i.e. define a standard for traceability. Also create and maintain a fully accessible web page containing, on an instrument basis, links to all instrument characteristics needed for intercomparisons as specified above, ideally in a common format. In addition, create and maintain a database (e.g. SADE) of instrument data for specific vicarious calibration sites, including site characteristics, in a common format. Each agency is responsible for providing data for their instruments in this common format. Recommendation : The required activities described above should be supported for an implementation period of two years and a maintenance period over two subsequent years. The CEOS should encourage a member agency to accept the lead role in supporting this activity.

The goal of the product is to provide the user with actual Sea Surface Temperature (SST) maps in a defined format easy to access with the highest possible reliability on the thematic quality. After a phase of definition, the operational production chain was launched in March 1993 covering the entire Mediterranean Sea and the Black Sea. Since then, daily, weekly, and monthly data sets have been available until September 13, 1994, when the AVHRR on board the NOAA-11 spacecraft failed. The production of daily, weekly and monthly SST maps was resumed in February, 1995, based on NOAA-14 AVHRR data. The NOAA-14 AVHRR sensor became some technical difficulties, so the generation was stopped on October 3, 2001. Since March 2002, NOAA-16 AVHRR SST maps are available again. With the beginning of January 2004, the data of AVHRR on board of NOAA-16 exhibited some anormal features showing strips in the scenes. Facing the “bar coded” images of NOAA16-AVHRR which occurred first in September 2003, continued in January 2004 for the second time and appeared in April 2004 again, DFD has decided to stop the reception of NOAA16 data on April 6th, 2004, and to start the reception of NOAA-17 data on this day. On April 7th, 2004, the production of all former NOAA16-AVHRR products as e.g. the SST composites was successully established. NOAA-17 is an AM sensor which passes central Europe about 2 hours earlier than NOAA-16 (about 10:00 UTC instead of 12:00 UTC for NOAA-16). In spring 2007, the communication system of NOAA-17 has degraded or is operating with limitations. Therefore, DFD has decided to shift the production of higher level products (NDVI, LST and SST) from NOAA-17 to NOAA-18 in April 2007. In order to test the performance of our processing chains, we processed simultaneously all NOAA-17 and NOAA-18 data from January 1st, 2007 till March 29th, 2007.

In addition, SST maps covering the North Atlantic, the Baltic Sea, the North Sea and the Western Atlantic equivalent to the Mediterranean MCSST maps are available since August 1994. The most important aspects of the MCSST maps are a) correct image registration and b) reasonable cloud screening to ensure that only cloud free pixels are taken for the later processing and compositing c) for deriving MCSST, only channel 4 and 5 are used..

    "description": "The AVHRR Mulitchannel Sea Surface Temperature Map (MCSST) was the first result of DLR's AVHRR pathfinder activities. The goal of the product is to provide the user with actual Sea Surface Temperature (SST) maps in a defined format easy to access with the highest possible reliability on the thematic quality. After a phase of definition, the operational production chain was launched in March 1993 covering the entire Mediterranean Sea and the Black Sea. Since then, daily, weekly, and monthly data sets have been available until September 13, 1994, when the AVHRR on board the NOAA-11 spacecraft failed. The production of daily, weekly and monthly SST maps was resumed in February, 1995, based on NOAA-14 AVHRR data. The NOAA-14 AVHRR sensor became some technical difficulties, so the generation was stopped on October 3, 2001. Since March 2002, NOAA-16 AVHRR SST maps are available again. With the beginning of January 2004, the data of AVHRR on board of NOAA-16 exhibited some anormal features showing strips in the scenes. Facing the “bar coded” images of NOAA16-AVHRR which occurred first in September 2003, continued in January 2004 for the second time and appeared in April 2004 again, DFD has decided to stop the reception of NOAA16 data on April 6th, 2004, and to start the reception of NOAA-17 data on this day. On April 7th, 2004, the production of all former NOAA16-AVHRR products as e.g. the SST composites was successully established. NOAA-17 is an AM sensor which passes central Europe about 2 hours earlier than NOAA-16 (about 10:00 UTC instead of 12:00 UTC for NOAA-16). In spring 2007, the communication system of NOAA-17 has degraded or is operating with limitations. Therefore, DFD has decided to shift the production of higher level products (NDVI, LST and SST) from NOAA-17 to NOAA-18 in April 2007. In order to test the performance of our processing chains, we processed simultaneously all NOAA-17 and NOAA-18 data from January 1st, 2007 till March 29th, 2007. All products are be available via EOWEB. Please remember that NOAA-18 is a PM sensor which passes central Europe about 1.5 hours later than NOAA-17 (about 11:30 UTC instead of 10:00 UTC for NOAA17). The SST product is intended for climate modelers, oceanographers, and all geo science-related disciplines dealing with ocean surface parameters. In addition, SST maps covering the North Atlantic, the Baltic Sea, the North Sea and the Western Atlantic equivalent to the Mediterranean MCSST maps are available since August 1994. The most important aspects of the MCSST maps are a) correct image registration and b) reasonable cloud screening to ensure that only cloud free pixels are taken for the later processing and compositing c) for deriving MCSST, only channel 4 and 5 are used.. The SST product consists of one 8 bit channel. For additional information, please see: https://wdc.dlr.de/sensors/avhrr/",

The data from different sensors and the resulting synergistic data products require a high level of accuracy that can only be obtained through continuous traceable calibration and validation activities.Requirement:Initiate an activity to document a reference methodology to predict Top of Atmosphere (TOA) radiance for which currently flying and planned wide swath sensors can be intercompared, i.e. define a standard for traceability. Also create and maintain a fully accessible web page containing, on an instrument basis, links to all instrument characteristics needed for intercomparisons as specified above, ideally in a common format. In addition, create and maintain a database (e.g. SADE) of instrument data for specific vicarious calibration sites, including site characteristics, in a common format.

Note, the IOP data are also included in the 'All Products' dataset. The inherent optical properties (IOP) dataset consists of the total absorption and particle backscattering coefficients, and, additionally, the fraction of detrital &amp; dissolved organic matter absorption and phytoplankton absorption. The total absorption (units m-1), the total backscattering (m-1), the absorption by detrital and coloured dissolved organic matter, the backscattering by particulate matter, and the absorption by phytoplankton share the same spatial resolution of ~4 km. The values of IOP are reported for the standard SeaWiFS wavelengths (412, 443, 490, 510, 555, 670nm). This data product is on a sinusoidal equal-area grid projection, matching the NASA standard level 3 binned projection. The default number of latitude rows is 4320, which results in a vertical bin cell size of approximately 4 km. The number of longitude columns varies according to the latitude, which permits the equal area property. Unlike the NASA format, where the bin cells that do not contain any data are omitted, the CCI format retains all cells and simply marks empty cells with a NetCDF fill value.

The ADAM product is made of gridded monthly mean climatologies over land and ocean surfaces, and of a companion API toolkit that enables the calculation of hyperspectral (at 1 nm resolution over the whole 240-4000 nm spectral range) and multidirectional reflectances (i.e. in any illumination/viewing geometry) depending on user choices. The ADAM climatologies that feed the ADAM calculation tools are: For ocean: monthly chlorophyll concentration derived from SeaWiFS-OrbView-2 (1999-2009); it is used to compute the water column reflectance (which shows large spectral variations in the visible, but is insignificant in the near and mid infrared). monthly wind speed derived from SeaWinds-QuikSCAT-(1999-2009); it is used to calculate the ocean glint reflectance. For land: monthly normalized surface reflectances in the 7 MODIS narrow spectral bands derived from FondsdeSol processing chain of MOD09A1 products (derived from Aqua and Terra observations), on which relies the modelling of the hyperspectral/multidirectional surface (soil/vegetation/snow) reflectance. uncertainty variance-covariance matrix for the 7 spectral bands associated to the normalized surface reflectance. For sea-ice: Sea ice pixels (masked in the original MOD09A1 products) have been accounted for by a gap-filling approach relying on the spatial-temporal distribution of sea ice coverage provided by the CryoClim climatology for year 2005.",

Along with the extraction, the algorithm re-orders the subset grid cells in a line-by-line fashion, so that the output subset is in array format and resembles a swath.

The ADAM climatologies that feed the ADAM calculation tools are: For ocean: monthly chlorophyll concentration derived from SeaWiFS-OrbView-2 (1999-2009); it is used to compute the water column reflectance (which shows large spectral variations in the visible, but is insignificant in the near and mid infrared). monthly wind speed derived from SeaWinds-QuikSCAT-(1999-2009); it is used to calculate the ocean glint reflectance. For land: monthly normalized surface reflectances in the 7 MODIS narrow spectral bands derived from FondsdeSol processing chain of MOD09A1 products (derived from Aqua and Terra observations), on which relies the modelling of the hyperspectral/multidirectional surface (soil/vegetation/snow) reflectance. uncertainty variance-covariance matrix for the 7 spectral bands associated to the normalized surface reflectance.

The data from different sensors and the resulting synergistic data products require a high level of accuracy that can only be obtained through continuous traceable calibration and validation activities.Requirement:Initiate an activity to document a reference methodology to predict Top of Atmosphere (TOA) radiance for which currently flying and planned wide swath sensors can be intercompared, i.e. define a standard for traceability. Also create and maintain a fully accessible web page containing, on an instrument basis, links to all instrument characteristics needed for intercomparisons as specified above, ideally in a common format. In addition, create and maintain a database (e.g. SADE) of instrument data for specific vicarious calibration sites, including site characteristics, in a common format. Each agency is responsible for providing data for their instruments in this common format. Recommendation : The required activities described above should be supported for an implementation period of two years and a maintenance period over two subsequent years. The CEOS should encourage a member agency to accept the lead role in supporting this activity. CEOS should request all member agencies to support this activity by providing appropriate information and data in a timely manner.Pseudo-Invariant Calibration Sites (PICS):Algeria 3 is one of six CEOS reference Pseudo-Invariant Calibration Sites (PICS) that are CEOS Reference Test Sites. Besides the nominally good site characteristics (temporal stability, uniformity, homogeneity, etc.), these six PICS were selected by also taking into account their heritage and the large number of datasets from multiple instruments that already existed in the EO archives and the long history of characterization performed over these sites. The PICS have high reflectance and are usually made up of sand dunes with climatologically low aerosol loading and practically no vegetation. Consequently, these PICS can be used to evaluate the long-term stability of instrument and facilitate inter-comparison of multiple instruments.",

    "description": "The Sigma0 product describes how much of the radar signal that was sent out by Sentinel-1 is reflected back to the sensor, and depends on the characteristics of the surface. This product is derived from the L1-GRD product. Typical SAR data processing, which produces level 1 images such as L1-GRD product, does not include radiometric corrections and significant radiometric bias remains. Therefore, it is necessary to apply the radiometric correction to SAR images so that the pixel values of the SAR images truly represent the radar backscatter of the reflecting surface. The radiometric correction is also necessary for the comparison of SAR images acquired with different sensors, or acquired from the same sensor but at different times, in different modes, or processed by different processors. For this Sigma0 product, radiometric calibration was performed using a specific Look Up Table (LUT) that is provided with each original GRD product. This LUT applies a range-dependent gain including the absolute calibration constant, in addition to a constant offset. Next to calibration, also orbit correction, border noise removal, thermal noise removal, and range doppler terrain correction steps were applied during production of Sigma0. The terrain correction step is intended to compensate for distortions due to topographical variations of the scene and the tilt of the satellite sensor, so that the geometric representation of the image will be as close as possible to the real world.",

    "description": "The Sigma0 product describes how much of the radar signal that was sent out by Sentinel-1 is reflected back to the sensor, and depends on the characteristics of the surface. This product is derived from the L1-GRD product. Typical SAR data processing, which produces level 1 images such as L1-GRD product, does not include radiometric corrections and significant radiometric bias remains. Therefore, it is necessary to apply the radiometric correction to SAR images so that the pixel values of the SAR images truly represent the radar backscatter of the reflecting surface. The radiometric correction is also necessary for the comparison of SAR images acquired with different sensors, or acquired from the same sensor but at different times, in different modes, or processed by different processors. For this Sigma0 product, radiometric calibration was performed using a specific Look Up Table (LUT) that is provided with each original GRD product. This LUT applies a range-dependent gain including the absolute calibration constant, in addition to a constant offset. Next to calibration, also orbit correction, border noise removal, thermal noise removal, and range doppler terrain correction steps were applied during production of Sigma0. The terrain correction step is intended to compensate for distortions due to topographical variations of the scene and the tilt of the satellite sensor, so that the geometric representation of the image will be as close as possible to the real world.",

This definition allows accounting for elements which are not flat such as needles or stems. LAI is strongly non linearly related to reflectance. Therefore, its estimation from remote sensing observations will be scale dependant over heterogeneous landscapes. When observing a canopy made of different layers of vegetation, it is therefore mandatory to consider all the green layers. This is particularly important for forest canopies where the understory may represent a very significant contribution to the total canopy LAI. The derived LAI corresponds therefore to the total green LAI, including the contribution of the green elements of the understory. The resulting SENTNEL LAI products are relatively consistent with the actual LAI for low LAI values and â&#128;&#152;non-forestâ&#128;&#153; surfaces; while for forests, particularly for needle leaf types, significant departures with the true LAI are expected.",

The main objective of the TanDEM-X mission is to create a precise 3D map of the Earth's land surfaces that is homogeneous in quality and unprecedented in accuracy. The data acquisition was completed in 2015 and production of the global DEM was completed in September 2016. The absolute height error is with about 1m an order of magnitude below the 10m requirement.The TanDEM-X 12m DEM is the nominal product variant of the global Digital Elevation Model (DEM) acquired in the frame of the German TanDEM-X mission between 2010 and 2015 with a spatial resolution of 0.4 arcseconds (12m at the equator).
