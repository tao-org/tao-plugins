Since it does not need other sources of light such as the sun, SAR has the advantage of providing satellite images regardless day or night. The frequency of transmitting and receiving microwave is L-band, which is less affected by clouds and rains. This all-weather observing capability is suitable for monitoring disasters rapidly. In addition, L-band microwave can reach to the ground partially penetrating through vegetation to obtain information of vegetation and ground surface. ALOS-2/PALSAR-2 will have a spotlight mode (1m*3m resolution in azimuth*range direction), whilst ALOS/PALSAR has a 10 m resolution. It will allow comprehensive monitoring of disasters by providing users with more detailed data than ALOS/PALSAR. The observation repetition frequency of ALOS-2 was improved by expanding the observable range of the satellite up to about 3 times (from 870km to 2,320km), as well as giving ALOS-2 a right-and-left looking function, which was not available on ALOS.",

The data from different sensors and the resulting synergistic data products require a high level of accuracy that can only be obtained through continuous traceable calibration and validation activities.Requirement:Initiate an activity to document a reference methodology to predict Top of Atmosphere (TOA) radiance for which currently flying and planned wide swath sensors can be intercompared, i.e. define a standard for traceability. Also create and maintain a fully accessible web page containing, on an instrument basis, links to all instrument characteristics needed for intercomparisons as specified above, ideally in a common format. In addition, create and maintain a database (e.g. SADE) of instrument data for specific vicarious calibration sites, including site characteristics, in a common format. Each agency is responsible for providing data for their instruments in this common format. Recommendation : The required activities described above should be supported for an implementation period of two years and a maintenance period over two subsequent years. The CEOS should encourage a member agency to accept the lead role in supporting this activity. CEOS should request all member agencies to support this activity by providing appropriate information and data in a timely manner.Pseudo-Invariant Calibration Sites (PICS):Algeria 3 is one of six CEOS reference Pseudo-Invariant Calibration Sites (PICS) that are CEOS Reference Test Sites. Besides the nominally good site characteristics (temporal stability, uniformity, homogeneity, etc.), these six PICS were selected by also taking into account their heritage and the large number of datasets from multiple instruments that already existed in the EO archives and the long history of characterization performed over these sites. The PICS have high reflectance and are usually made up of sand dunes with climatologically low aerosol loading and practically no vegetation. Consequently, these PICS can be used to evaluate the long-term stability of instrument and facilitate inter-comparison of multiple instruments.",

The processing of the 1A_SCSU product differs from that of the 1A_SCSB product for the following features: a non-weighted processing is performed, which means that windowing isn't applied on the processed bandwidth; radiometric equalisation (in terms of compensation of the range antenna pattern and incidence angle) is not performed; hence only compensation of the antenna transmitter gain and receiver attenuation and range spreading loss is applied.‚Ä¢ Level 1B - Detected Ground Multi-look (DGM): product obtained detecting, multi-looking and projecting the Single-look Complex Slant data onto a grid regular in ground.

    "description": "In Satellite Laser Ranging (SLR), a short pulse of coherent light generated by a laser (Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation) is transmitted in a narrow beam to illuminate corner cube retroreflectors on the satellite. The return signal, typically a few photons, is collected by a telescope and the time-of-flight is measured. Using information about the satellite's orbit, the time-of-flight, and the speed of light, the location of the ranging station can be determined. Similar data acquired by another station, many kilometers distant from the first, or on a different continent, can be used to determine the distance between stations to precisions of centimeters or better. Repetitive measurements over months and years yield the change in distance, or the motion of the Earth's crust.",

    "description": "GOES-13 is a satellite of the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) series operated by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Launched on May 24, 2006, it is designed to monitor weather conditions in North America, South America, and the Atlantic Ocean region. It operates in a geostationary orbit, meaning it remains fixed relative to Earth, continuously monitoring a specific region of the planet. In 2017, it was replaced by GOES-16 (GOES-East) as the primary operational weather satellite for the United States. Since then, it has been placed in a backup position. GOES-13/Imager instrument captures 1 visible and 4 infrared channels at resolutions of 1km (VIS) and 4km (IR). The collection captures product files into individual STAC Items for each observation from the GOES-13 satellite. It contains binary files in a grid format for each of the 5 spectral bands. The files are encoded using int16 and represent a matrix of values (reflectance for VIS and brightness temperature for IR) with 1714 lines and 1870 columns. Note: The values must be read as a one-dimensional array and then converted in memory to a two-dimensional m x n matrix. These versions are generated by INPE using the process of mapping data from the original geostationary projection to a uniform space-time geographic grid (EPSG:4326) with 0.04 degrees spatial resolution. The geographical area used in the remapping process was chosen because it covers and highlights Brazil, South and Central America. The image reprojection operation is performed using the gdalwarp utility (https://gdal.org/programs/gdalwarp.html) with the nearest neighbor resampling strategy defined.",

This results in a long image strip parallel to the flight direction: the transmitted pulse bandwidth is adjusted to always achieve a ground range resolution of 3 m. - Spot instrument mode: the radar beam is steered to illuminate a fixed point to increase the illumination time, resulting in an extended Synthetic aperture length, which improves the azimuth resolution. Spot mode uses a 300 MHz pulse bandwidth and provides a slant plane image with a resolution of 0.5 m (range) by 0.25 m (azimuth); when translated into the ground, the products has 1 m resolution covering an area of 5 km x 5 km. Due to multi-looking, speckle noise is significantly reduced - Scan Instrument mode: the phased array antenna is used to create multiple beams in the elevation direction which allows to acquire a large area (100km x 100km) with resolution better than 15m. To achieve the finest image quality of its Scan image, ICEYE employs a TOPSAR technique, which brings major benefits over the quality of the images obtained with conventional SCANSAR imaging. With the 2-dimensional electronic beam steering, TOPSAR ensures the maximum radar power distribution in the scene, providing uniform image quality. Two different processing levels can be requested: - Single Look Complex (SLC): Single Look Complex (SLC) Level 1a products consist of focused SAR data geo-referenced using orbit and attitude data from the satellite and the scenes are stored in the satellite's native image acquisition geometry which is the slant-range-by-azimuth imaging plane and with zero-Doppler SAR coordinates. The pixels are spaced equidistant in azimuth and in slant range. The products include a single look in each dimension using the full transmit signal bandwidth and consist of complex magnitude value samples preserving both amplitude and phase information. No radiometric artefacts induced by spatial resampling or geocoding. The product is provided in Hierarchical Data Format (HDF5) plus a xml file with selected metadata. - Ground Range Detected (GRD): Ground Range Detected (GRD) Level 1b products consist of focused SAR data that has been detected, multi-looked and projected to ground range using an Earth ellipsoid model. The image coordinates are oriented along the flight direction and along the ground range. Pixel values represent detected magnitude, the phase information is lost. The resulting product has approximately square spatial resolution pixels and square pixel spacing with reduced speckle due to the multi-look processing at the cost of worse spatial resolution. No image rotation to a map coordinate system has been performed and interpolation artefacts are thus avoided.

The imagery products gathered from IKONOS are categorised according to positional accuracy, which is determined by the reliability of an object in the image to be within the specified accuracy of the actual location of the object on the ground. Within each IKONOS-derived product, location error is defined by a circular error at 90% confidence (CE90), which means that locations of objects are represented on the image within the stated accuracy 90% of the time. There are six levels of IKONOS imagery products, determined by the level of positional accuracy: Geo, Standard Ortho, Reference, Pro, Precision and PrecisionPlus. The product provided by ESA to Category-1 users is the Geo Ortho Kit, consisting of IKONOS Black-and-White images with radiometric and geometric corrections (1-metre pixels, CE90=15 metres) bundled with IKONOS multispectral images with absolute radiometry (4-metre pixels, CE90=50 metres). IKONOS collects 1m and 4m Geo Ortho Kit imagery (nominally at nadir 0.82m for panchromatic image, 3.28m for multispectral mode) at an elevation angle between 60 and 90 degrees. To increase the positional accuracy of the final orthorectified imagery, customers should select imagery with IKONOS elevation angle between 72 and 90 degrees. The Geo Ortho Kit is tailored for sophisticated users such as photogrammetrists who want to control the orthorectification process. Geo Ortho Kit images include the camera geometry obtained at the time of image collection. Applying Geo Ortho Kit imagery, customers can produce their own highly accurate orthorectified products by using commercial off the shelf software, digital elevation models (DEMs) and optional ground control.",

The product provides the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), togetehr with some ancillary data as the radiation reflectance bands. The European METOP satellites were conceived by ESA/EUMETSAT to complement the geostationary METEOSATs. In this way they are analogue to the North-American NOAA-platforms which accompagny the geostationaries GOES-East and -West. Since mid-2007, METOP thus occupies the 'morning orbit' while NOAA assumes the 'noon orbit': the local solar time of the overpasses is around 9h30' for METOP and 14h for NOAA. Both platforms carry the same AVHRR instrument which scans the full earth surface at 1km resolution in five spectral bands: RED, NIR, SWIR, TIR1, TIR2. (During the night the SWIR-band is switched to MIR, but the ENDVI10 only deal with daytime registrations). Compared to NOAA, the METOP-AVHRR has been enhanced in three ways: the platform is perfectly stabilised which guarantees an optimal geo-correction of the imagery, all registered 1km data are stored on board and chanelled via the antenna of Svalbard (Sweden) to the central processing centre of EUMETSAT (Germany), and the latter performs the most crucial enhancement steps (rectification, calibration, cloud/snow detection) and broadcasts the results in real-time via its EUMETcast system.",

These climate drivers include (1) maximum normalized difference vegetation index (MaxNDVI) and time-integrated NDVI (TI-NDVI), (2) summer sea ice concentrations, (3) oceanic heat content, (4) land surface temperature, and (5) summer warmth index (SWI). Data are provided variously as timeseries and weekly and bi-weekly averages over selected time ranges and study regions with calculated trends and trend significance. Data collected over 33 years were compiled to observe seasonal trends of vegetation productivity and to detect dynamics between arctic vegetation and climate drivers.",

Note, the IOP data are also included in the 'All Products' dataset. The inherent optical properties (IOP) dataset consists of the total absorption and particle backscattering coefficients, and, additionally, the fraction of detrital &amp; dissolved organic matter absorption and phytoplankton absorption. The total absorption (units m-1), the total backscattering (m-1), the absorption by detrital and coloured dissolved organic matter, the backscattering by particulate matter, and the absorption by phytoplankton share the same spatial resolution of ~4 km. The values of IOP are reported for the standard SeaWiFS wavelengths (412, 443, 490, 510, 555, 670nm). This data product is on a sinusoidal equal-area grid projection, matching the NASA standard level 3 binned projection. The default number of latitude rows is 4320, which results in a vertical bin cell size of approximately 4 km. The number of longitude columns varies according to the latitude, which permits the equal area property. Unlike the NASA format, where the bin cells that do not contain any data are omitted, the CCI format retains all cells and simply marks empty cells with a NetCDF fill value. (A separate dataset is also available for data on a geographic projection.)",

To produce maps of Sea Level Anomalies (SLA) and Absolute Dynamic Topography (ADT) in delayed-time (REPROCESSED), the system uses the along-track altimeter missions from products called SEALEVEL*_PHY_L3_REP_OBSERVATIONS_008_*. Finally an Optimal Interpolation is made merging all the flying satellites in order to compute gridded SLA and ADT. The geostrophic currents are derived from sla (geostrophic velocities anomalies, ugosa and vgosa variables) and from adt (absolute geostrophic velicities, ugos and vgos variables). Note that the gridded products can be visualized on the LAS (Live Access Data) Aviso+ web page (http://www.aviso.altimetry.fr/en/data/data-access/las-live-access-server.html [http://www.aviso.altimetry.fr/en/data/data-access/las-live-access-server.html])",

    "description": "Doppler Orbitography by Radiopositioning Integrated on Satellite (DORIS) Cumulative Station Position Product from the NASA Crustal Dynamics Data Information System (CDDIS). DORIS is a dual-frequency Doppler system consisting of a receiver flying aboard a satellite and a globally distributed network of ground beacons. The DORIS receiver on-board the orbiting satellite tracks the dual-frequency radio signals transmitted by the network of ground beacons and generates the DORIS data. A measurement is made of either the Doppler shift or absolute phase as the satellite\u2019s orbit moves over the ground-based beacon. DORIS data records contain a time-tagged range-rate measurement with associated ancillary information. DORIS observations from a global network can be utilized for a variety of products. Analysis Centers (ACs) of the International DORIS Service (IDS) retrieve DORIS data on a regular basis to compute station position solutions for the DORIS beacons supporting the IDS network. The IDS Analysis Center Coordinator combines these individual AC solutions to generate a long-term DORIS position and velocity cumulative solution through a piecewise linear (position+velocity) model to describe the station motions. The cumulative position and velocity solution is obtained from the stacking of the weekly solution files and is then aligned to the current ITRF. The residuals of this stacking are of particular interest since they depict non-linear station motions.",
